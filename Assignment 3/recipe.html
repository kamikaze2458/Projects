    <h1><u>Egusi Soup Recipe</u></h1>
    <p>Egusi soup is a rich and flavorful West African dish, especially popular in Nigeria. It is made primarily from
        ground melon seeds (called "egusi"), which give the soup its distinctive thick texture and nutty taste. The soup
        is typically cooked with palm oil, leafy vegetables like bitterleaf or spinach, and a variety of proteins such
        as beef, goat meat, fish, or stockfish. Seasonings like crayfish, pepper, and traditional spices enhance its
        depth of flavor. Egusi soup is often enjoyed with pounded yam, fufu, or eba, making it a hearty and satisfying
        meal that reflects the vibrant culinary heritage of the region.</p>
