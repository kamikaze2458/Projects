      <h2>Student Information for AltSchool Africa.</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Kingsley Omodu, a  Cloud Engineering program student in the School of Engineering for the Karatu 2025 semester, with student ID ALT/SOE/025/4241. </p><br/>
I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the Rivers State University, and I'm currently running a master's program at the University of Vienna.<br/>
I have been working until recently as an IT Engineer for a firm in Nigeria, where I oversaw the M365 tenant administration for the firm.<br/>

Cloud computing has always been a career path I have taken a keen interest in, and Alt School Africa has given me the opportunity to study and become a professional in<br/>
cloud Engineering which has been a long life goal for me.<br/>

I joined the program to not only leverage the education provided but also to carve out a Niche as a Cloud Engineer.<br/>
Before now I have been having diverse opinions as to<br/> 
where i belong in the IT industry even though I have experience in Hardware Maintenance, Networking, Server Administration, etc.<br/>
I still wanted something I would say this<br/> 
is what I am, and thanks to Alt School Africa I have the opportunity to do just that with the Diploma in Cloud Engineering they are offering.<br/>
I hope to see myself as a cloud engineer in one year time which is the duration of the course. #AltSchooler
